Brandon Moy and Thomas Walsh

In class Professor Zewdie told us that our pattern implementations did not need to be on the Facility system so here are our examples of the Facade design pattern and Designer patterns. The example can be found within their own designated folders. To test the designer pattern, run the main method in "demo.java" to test the facade pattern run the main method in "Client.java". 

#What does the code do?
Both patterns have a correlation with vheicles where the Facade deals with inventory of cars designated to specific brands and body types for the dealership. The Designer pattern takes bodytypes of cars either suv or truck and gives them a color.

Feel free to email either of us if you have any questions.
